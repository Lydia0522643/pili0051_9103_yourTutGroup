### Imaging Technique Inspiration

#### The image I chose for my major assignment was ‘Wheels of fortune’. My Inspiration imaging technique inspiration is *aboriginal dot paintings*.

#### I considered incorporating vibrant and structured *pointillism* into my assignment. These elements provide *visual rhythm and harmony*, which creates an engaging, layered composition with both structural and organic design elements. It is useful when creating digital patterns or visualizations. The *recurring dots and radial symmetry of the piece* fit well with the potential for animation or dynamic visual displays in digital media. I think it's a useful technique for my main assignment.

### Coding Technique Exploration

#### I can use *Spiral Clock Dominik* in p5.js to help me achieve the desired effect. 

1. Each dot is represented by an instance of the *Vehicle class*. Each vehicle has *position, velocity and acceleration*. 
2. Use flow field to define the direction for movement at various locations. The vehicles follow the flow field, adjusting their movement based on the vectors that guide them.
3. Use init() method to create a spiraling effect and encourages the vehicles(dots) to move in a clockwise manner around the canvas center.
4. Use flow field to steer and update each vehicle’s position every frame. 

#### These functions help me to draw each point on a dot painting and make it rotate at a certain speed and direction to achieve a dynamic effect.
